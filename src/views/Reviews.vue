      <strong>-Hannah Peeters, 24</strong>
      <p>
        Since I was 10 years old, my dad has been sharing the zero distance
        experience with me. I have seen every prototype, every scrapped bit of
        writing, every version of this profound project. Yet every time I step
        inside an Observatory, I feel the same exhilaration wash over me. You
        need no background in non-duality, theology, or philosophy to understand
        the message. Because it’s simple. It feels like something you have
        always known and just forgotten along the way. Watch this film. Start to
        remember.

        Zero Distance makes you aware of the space we never think about. It
        exists in this world between your thoughts and what you see. I wish I
        could watch it for the first time again.

        A visual wonder and emotional probe into my mind. Each viewing is
        completely distinct from the last. Loved every bit of the film.

        Surreal. It takes you out of your own reality, and makes you question
        it.

      <strong>-James Silva, 29</strong>
      <p>
        A deep and beautiful exploration into, and out of, phenomenology.
        Peeters helps you find the self that you didn't know was lost and
        destroys what you thought knew about your conscious experience.

      <strong>-Jahida Velasquez, 22</strong>
      <p>
        This short film immerses you in an entrancing world of oneself. In these
        brief 15 minutes, you catch yourself wondering if you’ve been perceiving
        the world wrong all along, that you need to step back and see the world
        from a different perspective.

      <p>
        When you enter Tomas’ art, you may find that what you are attracted to
        is the mystery around the these almost otherworldly sculptural, and most
        decidedly functional devices. These futuristic-looking pieces are tools
        that provide the participator assistance in experiencing with what Tomas
        refers to as the empty eye of awareness.
      </p>

      <strong>-Susan Wachter, 56</strong>
      <p>
        Zerodistance is a beautiful, meditative piece. It pulls you right in as
        you examine perspective, distance and self. The score is gorgeous- it's
        like a well choreographed dance.
      </p>

      <strong>-Susanne Peeters, 50</strong>
      <p>
        I love the tempo, this sort of pulsing connectivity of light and sound
        and rhythm. I found myself watching the work and then at a certain point
        it felt like it was watching me. This shift is the exciting part. The
        tables turn. And then the tables disappear. It takes courage, maybe
        quiet courage, but nonetheless the kind that is filled with strength and
        openness. It is a taking off of the weight or burden of life, not a
        putting on. Come for the beauty, stay for the freedom, friend.
      </p>

      <strong>-Sam Wachter,16</strong>
      <p>
        Zero Distance has a very cinematic and hypnotic vibe to it in a really
        cool way. I felt immersed in it, as if I was the camera starring right
        back at Hannah. The music is stunning. The installation pieces shown
        blew me away. I loved the cinematography and the set-up of each shot.
        This is a very captivating piece of art.
      </p>

      <strong>-Becca Wachter, 26</strong>
      <p>
        This journey into consciousness is guided by an entrancing, symbiotic
        experience of light and form. The fundamental nature of reality is
        explored with a beautiful blurring of inward and outward, self and
        other, matter and void.
