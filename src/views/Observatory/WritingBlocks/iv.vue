      Observatory IV turns around the arrow of looking from<FancyBreak />
      the reflection of your face to the absence you are seeing from.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Observatory allows you to see that at zero distance<FancyBreak />
      from yourself, you do not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the reflection of your face collapses, you are no longer<FancyBreak />
      looking into the worldâ€”all of non existence is looking out of<FancyBreak />
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only what is absent is present, and non existence is here.<FancyBreak />
      You are here.
