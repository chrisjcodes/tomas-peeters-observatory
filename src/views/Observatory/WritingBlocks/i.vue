      This Observatory allows you to see that at zero distance from yourself,
      you are<FancyBreak />
      utterly empty.

    <p>
      When all distance collapses, you are no longer appearing in your
      experienceâ€”and<FancyBreak />
      yet, you are here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only seeing is present, and seeing is empty.<FancyBreak />
      You are this empty seeing.
